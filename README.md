This project is a simple JWT-based authentication API built using Node.js and Express. It demonstrates the core concepts of user authentication, including signup, signin, and accessing a protected route using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can register with a username and password, sign in to receive a JWT, and then use that token in the `Authorization` header to access the protected `/me` endpoint, which returns the logged-in user’s information. All user data is stored in memory for simplicity, making this project suitable for learning and understanding authentication flow rather than production use.
it also contains week-6 project which consist basic frontend and proper working of backend
